# House of Representatives compared to US Population

## About

The Congress froze the number of House members at 435 with the [Reapportionment Act of 1929](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reapportionment_Act_of_1911). The house reached 435 representatives in 1912. Since then, the U.S. population has increased from 92.2 million in 1910 to 309 million in 2010, more than tripling in size without *any* increase in the number of representatives.

In the US Constitution, it states that the number of House Representatives shall not exceed one in 30,000. While the 2010 value of 1 in 709,760 *technically* qualifies as "not exceeding 1 in 30,000", it seems to be a far-cry from the original framers' intents. The House member's average Constituency from 1789 to 1825 was about 48,700. If we were to follow that precedent, **we would have 6,300 House members.**

Listed below is a plot of the rapid decline in the voter's power of representation. I used a semilog Y-axis on the first plot, because a linear Y-axis resulted in the voter's representation after 1900 as being relatively microscopic.
